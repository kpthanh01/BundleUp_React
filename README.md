## Description
BundleUp is a website aimed at bringing prices down for the consumers by buying in mass. This applies to groupon style events, promises of contribution as consumers "go in" on buying large quantities of a product to get the best deal, posting events and deals you find as a consumer or offers as a vendor, and so much more! As people living in this turbulent time, our group likes buying smart - whether that's through costco deals or groupon. BundleUp is our solution for finding a way to easily access the best deals on the market.

## Getting Started
Our final product: https://bundleup-ga.netlify.app/

Our trello board: https://trello.com/b/Ui2i28Zs/bundleup

Our backend: https://github.com/kpthanh01/BundleUp_Express

## Attributions

- Additionally, we referenced GA class materials and used the Google AI feature for answering some questions.

## Technologies
In order to run locally, the front-end application requires the following:
- Axios
- React Router Dom

And the backend requires the following:
- bcrypt
- body-parser
- cors
- dotenv
- express
- jsonwebtoken
- mongoose
- morgan
- nodemon

## Next Steps
Moving onward, our steps would be to integrate a comment system on events and deals. Additionally, we would like to be able to have a robust filter system to allow a user to search for events and deals by keywords, location/proximity, cost, and more.
